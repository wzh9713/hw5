In my program, there could be up to two players operate at the same time. One player is the red figure, one player is the blue one. 
One players can click the bell then pass the mouse to the next person. 
There is a chance the monster will come out when the bell is triggered. The player who triggered the monster lose. 

TIP: If you feel you will trigger the monster in your next move, you can break the light instead and pass the mouse to the other player. Breaking light will not trigger the monster.
